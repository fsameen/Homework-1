## “Adjust” the dice or play with the random number generator. Can you get them to roll a 6 more or less often than would be expected? How would you know - what is “more often”? Can you write some code in R that will simulate a fair roll?
```
I think if I adjusted the dice and tried rolling it, it wouldn’t have an effect on whether the dice would roll a 6 more or less often than expected. I rolled a dice 20 times with a normal dice and then 40 times with an adjusted dice. The amount of times I got 6 with the normal dice was similar to the amount of times I got 6 with the adjusted dice. Thus, I concluded that I cannot get the dice to roll more or less than expected for the probability of getting a 6 while rolling all 60 times was 1/6. 

```
## Can you write some code in R that will simulate a fair roll?
```
dice = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6")
sample(x = dice, size = 20, replace = TRUE)
```
## Replicate the commands given in the lecture notes R Basics for Lecture 1 to do some simple stats on the PUMS-NY data. Those notes request that you find average ages for men and women after accounting for the top-coding. Tell me something else interesting, that you learned from the data, for example about educational attainments in different neighborhoods in the city. Are there surprises for you?
```
The data has a lot of information, but something that I found interesting was the relation between different areas and the educational attainments in those areas in New York. The educational attainment in various areas is very different from others, such as the average educational attainment in NYC is 0.3615, while the educational attainment in Staten Island is 0.02084 which is the lowest in the data. I didn’t expect that big of a difference between the two. Furthermore, according to the data the most used form of transportation is car, this is very unexpected because I had imagined that since millions of people use the public transportation to get to work every day, subway and buses would be the most used.

## Read about “hot hands fallacy” and tell if you think that helps investment strategy. 
```
Hot hands fallacy results when individuals base their expectations and predictions about an event based on an event just before that. Although, data shows that this usually leads people to make false assumptions, this is very common. I think hot hands fallacy doesn’t help investment because investors must assess markets using base rate information while considering the historical data and analysis. I think hot hands fallacy would lead to investors making erroneous investments.
